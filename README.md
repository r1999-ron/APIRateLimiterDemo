Math Expression Rate Limiter

This Java project is an Expression Evaluator that allows users to input mathematical expressions for evaluation. It employs multi-threading, a token bucket algorithm, and network communication to process expressions efficiently.

Key Features:
- Rate limits API requests to ensure compliance with external API restrictions.
- Processes mathematical expressions with efficiency and accuracy.
- Supports queuing and token bucket algorithm for rate control.

Dependencies:
- Java (JDK 8+)
