# APIRateLimiterDemo

## Problem Statement:
The program that accepts multiple mathematical expressions in bulk and evaluates each of them using any public Web API available. The program should display the result of each expression on the console. Letâ€™s assume that the API only supports 50 requests per second per client whereas our application is expected to evaluate at least 500 expressions per second. Also, the user may initiate more concurrent requests than our application can handle.

Math Expression Rate Limiter

This Java project is an Expression Evaluator that allows users to input mathematical expressions for evaluation. It employs multi-threading, a token bucket algorithm, and network communication to process expressions efficiently.

Key Features:
- Rate limits API requests to ensure compliance with external API restrictions.
- Processes mathematical expressions with efficiency and accuracy.
- Supports queuing and token bucket algorithm for rate control.

Key Components and Technologies:
- Java
- Multi-threading
- Token Bucket Algorithm
- Network Communication (HTTP)
- LinkedBlockingQueue
- Logging

Overview:
The Expression Evaluator project is designed to efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions while respecting API rate limits. It uses a combination of multi-threading and token bucket algorithm for optimal performance.

Features:
- Math Expression Input: Users can input mathematical expressions via the command line.

- Concurrent Processing: Expressions are processed concurrently using multiple threads.

- Rate Limiting: A token bucket algorithm ensures that API requests do not exceed a defined rate.

- Logging: Comprehensive logging captures processing details and potential errors.

Code Structure:
 The project follows the standard Java package structure and consists of the following key components:

- ExpressionEvaluatorApp: The main application class that orchestrates the entire process.
- Expression: A class representing an expression to be evaluated.
- acquireToken(): Method implementing the token bucket algorithm for rate limiting.
- callApi(): Method for making HTTP requests to an external math evaluation API.
- Logging: Extensive logging is used to record processing details and errors.

Overall Flow:

When the program starts, it reads expressions from the user and adds them to a queue. A separate processing thread retrieves expressions from the queue and sends them to an external API for evaluation while respecting rate limits. Results are logged, and the program gracefully exits when all expressions are processed.

Dependencies:
- Java (JDK 8+)
